The largest amount of work on the backend has been the implementation of the mapMaker module. This is the module that is able to take in coordinates of areas of the UK and output an array representing the region's terrain using free data (~3000 ascii files for the whole UK mainland) provided by Ordnance Survey. This module is also able to resize the output array to any size, larger or smaller (though clearly creation of a larger image results in estimation of data points) meaning that output PNG images can be created for any desired size. Currently the module only works for square regions but the next step is to implement rectangular region calculations.

The other module implemented in the modules folder is the conv module. This is not our code but is MIT licensed and available for free online. This module provides calculations for geocoding, speecifically for this project we use it to convert between the coordinate system used by mapping APIs (latitude and longitude) to the coordinate system used by the OS map data (Easting and Northing). We included this code to avoid having to make use of commercial geocoding APIs like those provided by Google and OS maps since these need to be payed for at a certain number of requests and we do not need the majority of the large range of services they provide.

Both of the above modules are tightly linked to the backend API calls (all calls return as JSON objects unless otherwise specified):

	/map 					-	Pass (OS) coordinates of a square region of the uk as well as optionally the size of the output image you would like. The call returns an array which is then constructed into a PNG by the browser using the HTML5 canvas. Only returning an array and not creating a PNG to send saves huge amounts of computation time on the server.

	/mappng					-	Used to return pre generated 256x256 PNG tiles at varying zoom levels so that mapping applications can create an easy to navigate view of the whole UK mainland at varying zoom levels. The PNGs were generated by using the /map API call repeatedly for large chunks of the UK and combining them in photoshop to create a 13200x26000 size PNG image. This image was then broken down into 256x256 chunks for varying levels of zoom and put into a structured folder layout.

	/latLonToOsGrid			-	Used to convert a given latitude and longitude point to the corresponding point in easting and northing coordinates.

	/osGridToLatLon			-	Used to convert a given easting and northing point to the corresponding point in latitude and longitude.

	/osGridToLatLonSquare	-	Takes in square coordinates in northing and easting format and generates the latitude and longitude coordinates of each of the corners of the square. This call is useful for the frontend as it means only making one api call rather than four.

The rest of the server is a stack using Node.js, Express and Angular. We have yet to set up a database but plan to use MongoDB or SQLite.
